- ❌ Scale transforms beyond subtle lifts
- ❌ Background gradient shifts on hover
- ❌ Pseudo-element ripple effects

### Stat Badges

- ❌ Bounce animations
- ❌ Rotation transforms
- ❌ Scale animations
- ❌ Complex cubic-bezier easing
- ❌ Gradient shift animations

### File Type Badges
- ❌ Bounce keyframe animations

- ❌ Excessive scale (1.15+)
- ❌ Expanding circle pseudo-elements

### Emoji

## Design Principles

### Modern & Clean
- Smooth, predictable animations
- Professional aesthetic
- No overwhelming effects
- Focus on content

### Performance
- Removed expensive 3D transforms
- Eliminated continuous animations
- Reduced JavaScript overhead
- Better battery life on mobile

### User Experience
- Subtle feedback on interaction
- No distracting movements
- Faster perceived performance
- Accessibility friendly

## Technical Summary

### Before
- **File size**: ~23KB (with complex effects)
- **Animations**: 15+ simultaneous effects per card
- **JavaScript**: Mouse tracking, ripples, parallax
- **Keyframes**: 10+ animation definitions

### After
- **File size**: ~15KB (simplified)
- **Animations**: 3-4 simple effects per card
- **JavaScript**: Only scroll reveal
- **Keyframes**: None (all CSS transitions)

## Color Scheme (Unchanged)
- Primary: `#667eea` → `#764ba2`
- Success: `#00d084` → `#00c9a7`
- Card gradient: `#ffffff` → `#f8f9ff` → `#fff5f7`
- Glassmorphism backdrop-filter

## Typography (Unchanged)
- Font: Inter (Google Fonts)
- Modern, clean, professional
- Variable font weights

## Result
A modern, fast, and elegant interface that focuses on content while providing just enough visual feedback to feel polished and responsive.
